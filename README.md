Code for solving the KdV (Korteweg de Vries) and mKdV equations, incorporating the amplitude as part of the parameter space.
All the models were trained in google colab using the T4 GPU.
When running in google colab, be sure the runtime is new and no other model has been trained during this runtime, or you won't be able to reproduce the results.
